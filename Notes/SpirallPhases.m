%% Note on the differences in minmal gradient time between different phases on the spiral. 
% Different phases literally have a different path length due to the
% initial condition. Therefore if I want to have an adequate optimization I
% need to set the initial conditions to k(1).


%% Strategy 1 - Center first point and calculate trajectory to initial point
% myself.
